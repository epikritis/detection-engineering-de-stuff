# Welcome to my Detection Engineering repo!

You may choose to set up the lab using the `de-lab-setup.md` file, or donwload the `de-lab-installer.sh` file to set up everything for you.

If you opt for the latter, you still need to modify a few things in the `.env` files.

This lab is designed to work on a VM with 4 vCPU and 8 GB RAM. You may choose the amount of storage you would want to have, but keep in mind that you need about 30 GB for the OS files, and some additional storage for the data ingested by your agents.

This lab works best on a cloud environment, but this costs money. You can make a few changes and deploy it locally. For a cloud deployment, I tested this on Azure as I have the ability to turn off my VM and save some compute expenses. Before selecting a cloud service provider, make sure to check if you can save on compute costs by turning off the VM.
